# Cordic
COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer

#Description
The codic algoritm is used for calculating varoius functions such as trignometric and fft.
This implimentation in C is for calculating some of these with fixed point arithmatics.
The following are aimed to be created
1. Trignometric fuctions
2. Fast fourier and inverse fast fourier transforms
--More to come
