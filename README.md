# Cordic
COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer

#Description
The cordic algorithm is used for calculating various functions such as trigonometric and fft.
This implementation in C is for calculating some of these with fixed point arithmetics.
The following are aimed to be created
1. Trigonometric functions
2. Fast fourier and inverse fast fourier transforms
--More to come

#Limitations
Currently supports only two powered number of points for fft
Doesn't support decimation in time
Sine wave only with sampling greater than nyquist rate

#TODO
1. Full integer calculations
2. Proper commenting
3. Any point fft
4. Any frequency sine wave.
